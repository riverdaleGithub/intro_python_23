# 🧙‍♂️ Python Lab: The Potion Mixer! 🧪

## Objective 🎯
Learn to create functions and use `if/else` statements in Python to simulate the magical process of mixing potions with various effects.

## Story 📖
As an apprentice in a mystical apothecary, your task is to mix potions with magical ingredients. Each ingredient affects the potion differently, and you must use your Python skills to achieve the desired magical results.

## Lab Tasks 📝

### Task 1: The Basic Potion 🧴
Create a function named `mix_potion` that takes an `ingredient` parameter. Depending on the ingredient, the potion will change color. You'll use `if` and `elif` statements to check the ingredient and `print` the potion's color.

- Remember the syntax for a function definition starts with `def` followed by the function name and parentheses `()`.
- Parameters go inside the parentheses next to the function name.
- Use `if` for the first condition, `elif` for additional conditions, and `else` for the final condition when none of the `if` or `elif` conditions are met.
- Indentation is crucial in Python to define the scope of your conditions and actions.


### Task 2: Potion Effects 🌟
Add special effects to the potions. Depending on the ingredients, the potion can have additional properties like sparkling, glowing, or even exploding.

- Use nested `if` statements to create sub-conditions within a condition.
- Think about how you can check for specific combinations of ingredients to create unique effects.



### Reflection 🤔

After completing the tasks, create a video where you reflect on the following:

1. How did the use of `if/else` statements help you control the flow of your potion-making function?
2. What challenges did you encounter when checking for multiple conditions, and how did you overcome them?
3. In what ways can you apply the function creation and decision-making skills you've practiced here to other programming problems?
